# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
This analysis was conducted to show the leaders at PyBer the total weekly fares for each city type (i.e. Rural vs. Suburban vs. Urban). 

## Results

### Summary Table

We can get the following insights from the Summary table (see below).
* The **Total values** (i.e. Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares) are much higher in the *Urban cities* compared to the *Rural cities*.
* The **Average values** (i.e. Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver) are much higher in the *Rural cities* compared to the *Urban cities*. Based on this, we can expect customers to pay more per ride in the *Rural cities* as compared to the *Urban cities*.
* The greatest shortage in Total Drivers vs. Total Rides is in the Suburban Cities.
* The greatest surplus of Total Drivers vs. Total Rides is in the Urban Cities.

## Summary - Business Recommendations 
1. Invest in hiring more drivers in the Suburban cities as there is a surplus of rides/driver there.
2. Buy more taxis in the Suburban cities to be able to meet the demand of rides.
3. Consider incentives to move drivers/taxis from the Urban setting to the Suburban setting.
