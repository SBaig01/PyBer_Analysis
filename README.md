# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
This analysis was conducted to show the leaders at PyBer the total weekly fares for each city type (i.e. Rural vs. Suburban vs. Urban). 

## Results

describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

We can get the following insights from the Summary table (see below).
* The Total values (i.e. Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares) are much higher in the Urban cities compared to the Rural cities.
* The Average values (i.e. Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver) are much higher in the Rural cities compared to the Urban cities.
